    "In TorchSharp, as in all deep learning, the fundamental data type is a 'tensor,' which is simply a generalized matrix. In Linear Algebra, a one-dimensional arrays are called 'vector,' and a two-dimensional array is a 'matrix.' Generalizing on that, a tensor is simply an N-dimensional array. \n",

Think of the first dimension as the rows of a table, the second as the columns, and then you just have to generalize things in your head after that. In the examples below, we'll mostly be creating 3x4 matrices, for simplicity.\n",

    "One thing to note is that .NET Interactive will show the object and its fields, etc. when you say just 't' at the end of the notebook cell.
